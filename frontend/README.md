## Background

This frontend was originally developed for the previous service (AI detection writing training).
It is now inactive as the service has pivoted to a TOPIK scoring mobile app.

## Future Plans (v2)

This codebase may be repurposed as an admin dashboard in v2:

- Scoring statistics dashboard
- AI vs actual score analysis
- User feedback management
- AI detection statistics

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15.3.3
- React 19.1.0
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4.1.10
- shadcn/ui

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
